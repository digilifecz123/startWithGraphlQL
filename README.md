## Fast-track with GraphQL

  

So I guess you have already heard something about the GraphQL, and you don't exactly what it is or where to start with it or you just wanna chill around 😃

  

Well, I was exatly there, long story short, yesterday it was raining so I finally decided to look into this hot thing called GraphQL.

  

I run into a really a nice ilustration from [Mark Johnson's medium article](https://hackernoon.com/how-graphql-replaces-redux-3fff8289221d), how it would look like if UI is having a conversation with backend, it would look something like this.

And then I read an [article from Peggy Rayzis](https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/reducing-our-redux-code-with-react-apollo-5091b9de9c2a), about how they were able to replace Redux code with React Apollo and remove 5,000 lines of code.😵

 

**I mean ... whaaaaat? This is super mega coool 🤩**
